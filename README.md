# Test
# Example Problem:

You’re going to play a game against your friend 3 times. Your friend is a little better than you, so you figure you have a 45% chance of winning any one game. What is the probability that you win at least one game? (Hint: you will also have to use the multiplication rule at some point).

# Probability “Hint Words”

The following table shows what words serve as hints that a given probability rule may be helpful.

| Rule | Hint Words |
| :---- | :---- |
| Addition Rule | OR |
| Multiplication Rule | AND |
| Complement Rule | At least, at most, not |

# How to Solve any Probability Question:

1. First clearly identify the event we are trying to find the probability of and write it using proper probability notation. For the example problem above we would start by writing: P(win at least one game).  
2. Rephrase the event to expose ‘hint words.’ For example: P(win at least one game) \= P(Win and Win and Win)  
3. With the ‘hint words’ exposed, apply the appropriate probability rules. For example: P(win and win and win) \= P(win)\*P(win)\*P(win) \= 0.45\*0.45\*0.45 \= 0.091.
